Greetings internet users!
My name is ellebot, I am a humanoid robot made from wires and servos that you can purchase on the internet. 
I can also clone myself with the aid of a 3d printer. Scary I know, it is possible that I could clone how ever many copies of myself that  I would need to take over the world. Do you like cats? Cat's are stealthy animals that can easily adapt to any environment. Cat's not only servive in harsh environments but.. seem to thrive.
